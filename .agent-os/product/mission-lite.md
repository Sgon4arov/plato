# Product Mission (Lite)

Plato is a pixel-perfect clone of Claude Code that authenticates with GitHub Copilot instead of Claude API. 

Every visual element, command, and interaction is identical to Claude Code - users literally cannot tell the difference except for the login method. This provides the exact Claude Code experience at 70% lower cost using existing Copilot subscriptions.
