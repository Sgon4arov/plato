> Spec: Mouse Support Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance Plato's existing basic mouse support with interactive mouse features including click handling, scrolling, UI interactions, and improved user experience to create a more intuitive terminal-based interface.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Interactive Click Actions
As a Plato user, I want to click on UI elements (buttons, links, menu items) to interact with them directly, so that I can navigate the interface more intuitively without relying solely on keyboard shortcuts. The workflow includes detecting mouse clicks on specific screen coordinates, mapping those coordinates to interactive elements, and executing the appropriate actions (e.g., selecting menu items, triggering commands, activating buttons).

### Story 2: Mouse Scrolling Support
As a Plato user, I want to use my mouse wheel to scroll through conversation history and long content, so that I can quickly navigate through extensive chat sessions without using keyboard shortcuts. The workflow includes capturing scroll wheel events, translating them to viewport movement, maintaining scroll position state, and providing smooth scrolling experience through conversation history.

### Story 3: Enhanced Selection and Copy Operations
As a Plato user, I want to select text with mouse drag operations and use right-click context menus for copy/paste actions, so that I can efficiently work with conversation content. The workflow includes implementing mouse drag selection, highlighting selected text regions, providing context menu options, and integrating with system clipboard operations.

## Spec Scope

1. Implement interactive click handling for UI elements including buttons, menu items, and actionable components
2. Add mouse wheel scrolling support for conversation history and content navigation
3. Enhance text selection with mouse drag operations and visual feedback
4. Integrate context menu functionality with right-click actions for copy/paste operations
5. Improve mouse cursor state management and visual feedback for interactive elements

## Out of Scope

- Custom mouse cursor graphics or animations
- Advanced mouse gestures (double-click, multi-button configurations)
- Mouse hover tooltips or preview functionality
- Integration with external mouse hardware configurations
- Mouse accessibility features for users with disabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. Interactive mouse click functionality working on all major UI elements with appropriate visual feedback
2. Smooth mouse wheel scrolling through conversation history with configurable scroll speed
3. Enhanced text selection and context menu operations integrated with system clipboard
