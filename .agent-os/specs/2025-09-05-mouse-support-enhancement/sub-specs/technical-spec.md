# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-mouse-support-enhancement/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-05
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Mouse Event Handling Architecture

**Event Capture System**:
- Extend existing ANSI escape sequence handling in keyboard-handler.tsx for SGR mouse mode (\x1b[?1006h)
- Implement mouse event parser for click coordinates, button states, and scroll wheel events
- Add mouse event state management to KeyboardState interface with click tracking and scroll position
- Integrate with existing raw mode detection and fallback handling for WSL compatibility

**Click Handling Infrastructure**:
- Coordinate mapping system to translate terminal coordinates to React component regions
- Click target identification using bounding box calculations for UI elements
- Event dispatch system to route clicks to appropriate component handlers
- State management for click feedback and visual highlighting

**Scrolling Implementation**:
- Mouse wheel event detection and translation to viewport movement
- Smooth scrolling algorithm with configurable scroll speed and acceleration
- Content overflow detection and scroll boundary enforcement
- Integration with existing conversation history display system

### UI/UX Specifications

**Interactive Elements Enhancement**:
- Click target zones for slash commands, menu items, and status indicators
- Visual feedback system with hover states and click confirmation
- Cursor state management showing pointer vs text cursor based on target type
- Accessibility compliance with keyboard navigation fallback for all mouse interactions

**Text Selection and Context Menu**:
- Mouse drag selection implementation with start/end coordinate tracking
- Text highlighting overlay system using React/Ink Box components
- Right-click context menu with copy/paste/select-all operations
- Integration with existing system clipboard through process.stdout writes

**Visual Feedback System**:
- Interactive element highlighting using picocolors for terminal color support
- Selection overlay rendering with background color changes
- Loading states and click confirmation indicators
- Status line updates for mouse interaction feedback

### Integration Requirements

**React/Ink Framework Integration**:
- Component-level mouse event handling hooks integrated with useInput system
- Mouse event propagation through React component tree
- State synchronization between mouse events and keyboard state management
- Performance optimization to prevent re-renders during mouse movement

**Existing Architecture Compatibility**:
- Seamless integration with current mouseMode toggle functionality
- Preservation of existing paste detection and buffer management
- Compatibility with raw mode detection and WSL fallback systems
- Integration with session persistence and state recovery

**Cross-Platform Considerations**:
- Terminal capability detection for mouse support availability
- Graceful fallback to keyboard-only mode when mouse not supported
- WSL and Docker environment compatibility with escape sequence handling
- Terminal size and coordinate system adaptation

### Performance Criteria

**Event Processing Performance**:
- Mouse event processing latency < 50ms for responsive interaction
- Scroll event handling with smooth 60fps scrolling animation
- Memory efficient event queue management with maximum 100 queued events
- CPU usage < 5% during active mouse interaction

**Rendering Optimization**:
- Selective re-rendering only for affected components during mouse events
- Efficient coordinate calculation using cached bounding box data
- Debounced scroll events to prevent excessive re-rendering
- Optimized text selection rendering with minimal screen updates

**Memory Management**:
- Event listener cleanup on component unmount
- Bounded event history with automatic cleanup of old events
- Efficient selection state storage with coordinate compression
- Memory usage increase < 10MB for mouse enhancement features

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required. The implementation will leverage existing project dependencies:

- **React (^19.1.1)**: Component-level event handling and state management
- **Ink (^6.2.3)**: Terminal UI framework with Box component for selection overlay
- **picocolors (^1.0.0)**: Terminal color support for visual feedback
- **@types/react (^19.1.12)**: TypeScript definitions for React components

All mouse functionality will be implemented using native Node.js APIs and ANSI escape sequences, building upon the existing terminal interaction infrastructure without requiring additional third-party libraries.
