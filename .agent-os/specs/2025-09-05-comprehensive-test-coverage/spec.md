# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comprehensive Test Coverage
> Created: 2025-09-05

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive test suite for Plato V3 to validate all 41 slash commands, core functionality, and Claude Code parity behaviors. This will establish confidence in the codebase, enable safe refactoring, and provide regression protection as the product evolves.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Story

As a **developer**, I want to **run automated tests before committing changes**, so that **I can ensure I haven't broken existing functionality**.

When developing new features or fixing bugs, I need confidence that my changes don't introduce regressions. I should be able to run a simple command like `npm test` and see clear pass/fail results for all components. The test suite should run quickly (under 60 seconds) and provide detailed failure information when something breaks.

### CI/CD Pipeline Story  

As a **DevOps engineer**, I want to **integrate automated testing into the CI pipeline**, so that **pull requests are automatically validated before merging**.

Our GitHub Actions workflow needs to run the full test suite on every pull request. Tests should validate across multiple Node.js versions (18, 20, 22) and operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows). Failed tests should block merging and provide clear feedback about what needs fixing.

### Claude Code Parity Validation Story

As a **product owner**, I want to **verify Claude Code parity through automated tests**, so that **we can confidently claim 100% compatibility**.

Every Claude Code behavior that Plato replicates needs a corresponding test. This includes command output formats, keyboard shortcuts, file operations, and error messages. Tests should compare actual output against expected Claude Code patterns to ensure pixel-perfect parity.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions, classes, and modules in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Integration Tests** - Validate interactions between components like TUI, orchestrator, and providers
3. **Command Tests** - Verify all 41 slash commands produce correct output and behavior
4. **E2E Tests** - Simulate real user workflows from login to file editing to session management
5. **Parity Tests** - Compare Plato output against Claude Code expected formats

## Out of Scope

- Performance benchmarking tests (separate spec)
- Load testing or stress testing
- Visual regression testing of terminal UI
- Testing of external dependencies (GitHub Copilot API)
- Browser-based testing (terminal only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A test suite with 80%+ code coverage that runs via `npm test` in under 60 seconds
2. All 41 slash commands have at least one test validating their core functionality
3. GitHub Actions workflow configured to run tests on all PRs across multiple environments
