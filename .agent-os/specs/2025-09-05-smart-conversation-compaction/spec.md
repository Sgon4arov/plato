> Spec: Smart Conversation Compaction with Intelligent Context Preservation
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance Plato's existing basic conversation compaction system with intelligent semantic analysis and context preservation to maintain conversational coherence while reducing token usage. Replace current simple truncation methods with sophisticated relevance scoring and thread-aware compaction that preserves critical context.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer with Long Debugging Session
As a developer debugging a complex issue over multiple hours, I want the conversation to be intelligently compacted so that when I reference earlier findings, the AI still has access to relevant debugging context and can maintain continuity in the troubleshooting process without losing critical problem-solving threads.

**Workflow**: Developer starts debugging → conversation grows beyond token limits → smart compaction preserves key debugging steps, error patterns, and solution attempts → developer references earlier context → AI responds with full awareness of debugging history.

### Story 2: Architect Planning Complex System
As a software architect discussing system design across multiple sessions, I want conversation compaction to preserve architectural decisions, design patterns, and requirement discussions so that when I continue the conversation later, the context of previous design choices remains intact.

**Workflow**: Architect discusses requirements → explores multiple design approaches → conversation gets compacted → architect returns to refine design → AI maintains awareness of rejected approaches and reasoning → provides consistent architectural guidance.

### Story 3: Code Review and Iterative Improvement
As a developer conducting iterative code improvements, I want the AI to remember previous feedback, attempted solutions, and quality concerns even after compaction so that subsequent iterations build upon earlier insights rather than repeating suggestions.

**Workflow**: Developer requests code review → receives detailed feedback → implements changes → requests follow-up review → conversation compacted → AI provides focused feedback aware of previous iterations and concerns.

## Spec Scope

1. **Semantic Analysis Engine**: Implement intelligent content analysis that identifies and scores conversation elements based on semantic importance, technical relevance, and contextual relationships.

2. **Thread-Aware Preservation**: Develop conversation thread detection that maintains logical discussion flows by preserving related messages, decision points, and their outcomes across compaction cycles.

3. **Context Scoring System**: Create multi-dimensional relevance scoring that evaluates messages based on recency, reference frequency, technical importance, and decision impact to prioritize retention.

4. **Intelligent Compaction Strategy**: Replace truncation-based compaction with selective preservation that maintains conversation coherence while achieving target token reduction goals.

5. **Compaction Quality Metrics**: Implement validation system that measures context preservation effectiveness and provides feedback on compaction decisions to ensure conversation quality.

## Out of Scope

- Complete conversation rewriting or summarization that loses original message structure
- Real-time compaction during active conversations (focus on between-session processing)
- Integration with external knowledge bases or conversation analytics
- Multi-user conversation compaction scenarios
- Custom user-defined preservation rules or manual selection interfaces

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Smart Compaction**: System successfully reduces conversation token usage by 40-60% while preserving 90%+ of contextually relevant information as measured by follow-up question accuracy.

2. **Thread Continuity Validation**: Conversations maintain logical flow after compaction with AI able to reference preserved context accurately in 95%+ of cases where previous context is relevant.

3. **Performance Integration**: Smart compaction completes processing within 2-3 seconds for typical conversation lengths without impacting Plato's response time or user experience.
