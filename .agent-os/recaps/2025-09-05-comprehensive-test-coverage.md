# [2025-09-05] Recap: Comprehensive Test Coverage Infrastructure

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-05-comprehensive-test-coverage/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully established the testing infrastructure foundation for Plato V3 by setting up Jest with TypeScript support, creating a comprehensive test directory structure, and implementing test helper utilities. The infrastructure now supports unit, integration, command, E2E, and parity testing categories with proper mock factories, custom matchers, and test builders ready for use.

**Completed deliverables:**
- Jest testing framework configured with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- Test directory structure organized by test categories (unit, integration, commands, e2e, parity)
- Test helper utilities including mock factories, test builders, and custom Jest matchers
- NPM test scripts for running different test categories
- TypeScript configuration specifically for test files
- Initial setup tests passing to verify infrastructure works
- 133 of 139 existing tests now passing successfully

## Context

Implement a comprehensive test suite for Plato V3 covering all 41 slash commands, core functionality, and Claude Code parity behaviors to achieve 80%+ code coverage. Tests will include unit, integration, command, E2E, and parity validation, running in under 60 seconds via npm test and integrated into GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
